        <li>Whats sushi?: Sushi is a popular Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice (sushi rice) topped with various ingredients, most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked), but also vegetables.

            The sushi rice is seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, giving it a tangy and sweet flavor. Â
